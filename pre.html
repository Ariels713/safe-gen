            terms.</p>


        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><strong>1. <em>Events</em></strong></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">(a) <strong>Equity Financing</strong>. If there is an Equity
            Financing before the expiration or termination of this instrument, the Company will automatically issue to
            the Investor a number of shares of Safe Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Discount
            Price. </p>


        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">In connection with the issuance of Safe Preferred Stock by the
            Company to the Investor pursuant to this Section 1(a):</p>
        \
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">(i) The Investor will execute and deliver to the Company all
            transaction documents related to the Equity Financing; provided, that such documents are the same documents
            to be entered into with the purchasers of Standard Preferred Stock, with appropriate variations for the Safe
            Preferred Stock if applicable, and provided further, that such documents have customary exceptions to any
            drag-along applicable to the Investor, including, without limitation, limited representations and warranties
            and limited liability and indemnification obligations on the part of the Investor; and </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">(ii) The Investor and the Company will execute a Pro Rata
            Rights Agreement, unless the Investor is already included in such rights in the transaction documents
            related to the Equity Financing.</p>



        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">(b) <strong>Liquidity Event</strong>. If there is a Liquidity
            Event before the
            expiration or termination of this instrument, the Investor will, at its option, either (i) receive a cash
            payment equal to the Purchase Amount (subject to the following paragraph) or (ii) automatically receive from
            the Company a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Liquidity Price,
            if the Investor fails to select the cash option. </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"></p>In connection with Section (b)(i), the Purchase Amount will
        be due and payable by the Company to the Investor immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation of
        the Liquidity Event. If there are not enough funds to pay the Investor and holders of other Safes (collectively,
        the “Cash-Out Investors”) in full, then all of the Company’s available funds will be distributed with equal
        priority and pro rata among the Cash-Out Investors in proportion to their Purchase Amounts, and the Cash-Out
        Investors will automatically receive the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the remaining unpaid Purchase
        Amount divided by the Liquidity Price. In connection with a Change of Control intended to qualify as a tax-free
        reorganization, the Company may reduce, pro rata, the Purchase Amounts payable to the Cash-Out Investors by the
        amount determined by its board of directors in good faith to be advisable for such Change of Control to qualify
        as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and in such case, the Cash-Out Investors will
        automatically receive the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the remaining unpaid Purchase Amount divided
        by the Liquidity Price.</p>



        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">(c) <strong>Dissolution Event</strong>. If there is a
            Dissolution Event before
            this instrument expires or terminates, the Company will pay an amount equal to the Purchase Amount, due and
            payable to the Investor immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation of the Dissolution Event.
            The Purchase Amount will be paid prior and in preference to any Distribution of any of the assets of the
            Company to holders of outstanding Capital Stock by reason of their ownership thereof. If immediately prior
            to the consummation of the Dissolution Event, the assets of the Company legally available for distribution
            to the Investor and all holders of all other Safes (the “Dissolving Investors”), as determined in good faith
            by the Company’s board of directors, are insufficient to permit the payment to the Dissolving Investors of
            their respective Purchase Amounts, then the entire assets of the Company legally available for distribution
            will be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the Dissolving Investors in proportion to the
            Purchase Amounts they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 1(c).</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">(d) <strong>Termination</strong>. This instrument will expire
            and terminate
            (without relieving the Company of any obligations arising from a prior breach of or non-compliance with
            this instrument) upon either (i) the issuance of stock to the Investor pursuant to Section 1(a) or Section
            1(b)(ii); or (ii) the payment, or setting aside for payment, of amounts due the Investor pursuant to Section
