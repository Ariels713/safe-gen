                    <li>
                        <strong>Equity Financing.</strong> If there is an Equity Financing before the expiration or
                        termination of this instrument, the Company will automatically issue to the Investor a number of
                        shares of Preferred Stock sold in the Equity Financing equal to the Purchase Amount divided by
                        the price per share of the Preferred Stock.
                        <br>In connection with the issuance of such shares of Preferred Stock to the Investor pursuant
                        to this Section 1(a):

                                to the Equity Financing; provided, that such documents are the same documents to be
                                entered into with the purchasers of Preferred Stock, and provided further, that such
                                documents have customary exceptions to any drag-along applicable to the Investor,
                                including, without limitation, limited representations and warranties and limited
                                liability and indemnification obligations on the part of the Investor; and

                                The Investor and the Company will execute a Pro Rata Rights Agreement, unless the
                                Investor is already included in such rights in the transaction documents related to the
                                Equity Financing.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Liquidity Event.</strong> If there is a Liquidity Event before the expiration or
                        termination of this instrument, the Investor will, at its option, either (i) receive a cash
                        payment equal to the Purchase Amount (subject to the following paragraph) or (ii) automatically
                        receive from the Company a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided
                        by the fair market value of the Common Stock at the time of the Liquidity Event (determined by
                        reference to the purchase price payable in connection with such Liquidity Event) (the "Liquidity
                        Price"), if the Investor fails to select the cash option.
                        <br>In connection with Section (b)(i), the Purchase Amount will be due and payable by the
                        Company to the Investor immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation of the
                        Liquidity Event. If there are not enough funds to pay the Investor and holders of other Safes
                        (collectively, the "Cash-Out Investors") in full, then all of the Company's available funds will
                        be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the Cash-Out Investors in proportion to
                        their Purchase Amounts, and the Cash-Out Investors will automatically receive the number of
                        shares of Common Stock equal to the remaining unpaid Purchase Amount divided by the Liquidity
                        Price. In connection with a Change of Control intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization,
                        the Company may reduce, pro rata, the Purchase Amounts payable to the Cash-Out Investors by the
                        amount determined by its board of directors in good faith to be advisable for such Change of
                        Control to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and in
                        such case, the Cash-Out Investors will automatically receive the number of shares of Common
                        Stock equal to the remaining unpaid Purchase Amount divided by the Liquidity Price.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Dissolution Event.</strong> If there is a Dissolution Event before this instrument
                        expires or terminates, the Company will pay an amount equal to the Purchase Amount, due and
                        payable to the Investor immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation of the
                        Dissolution Event. The Purchase Amount will be paid prior and in preference to any Distribution
                        of any of the assets of the Company to holders of outstanding Capital Stock by reason of their
                        ownership thereof. If immediately prior to the consummation of the Dissolution Event, the assets
                        of the Company legally available for distribution to the Investor and all holders of all other
                        Safes (the "Dissolving Investors"), as determined in good faith by the Company's board of
                        directors, are insufficient to permit the payment to the Dissolving Investors of their
                        respective Purchase Amounts, then the entire assets of the Company legally available for
                        distribution will be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the Dissolving Investors
                        in proportion to the Purchase Amounts they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to
                        this Section 1(c).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Termination.</strong> This instrument will expire and terminate (without relieving the
                        Company of any obligations arising from a prior breach of or non-compliance with this
                        instrument) upon either (i) the issuance of stock to the Investor pursuant to Section 1(a) or
                        Section 1(b)(ii); or (ii) the payment, or setting aside for payment, of amounts due the Investor
