                    THEREFROM. </p>

                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">THIS CERTIFIES THAT in exchange for the payment by [investorName] (the
                    "<strong>Investor</strong>") of [investmentAmount] (the "<strong>Purchase Amount</strong>") on or
                    about [dateOfSafe], [companyName], a [stateIncorporation] corporation (the
                    "<strong>Company</strong>"), issues to the Investor the right to certain shares of the Company's
                    Capital Stock, subject to the terms described below.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">This Safe is one of the forms available at <a
                        href="http://ycombinator.com/documents">http://ycombinator.com/documents</a> and the Company and
                    the Investor agree that neither one has modified the form, except to fill in blanks and bracketed

                    terms.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><strong>1. <em>Events</em></strong></p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">(a) <strong>Equity Financing</strong>. If there is an
                    Equity Financing before the termination of this Safe, on the initial closing of such Equity
                    Financing, this Safe will automatically convert into the greater of: (1) the number of shares of
                    Standard Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the lowest price per share of the
                    Standard Preferred Stock; or (2) the number of shares of Safe Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase
                    Amount divided by the Safe Price. </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">In connection with the automatic conversion of this
                    Safe into shares of Standard Preferred Stock or Safe Preferred Stock, the Investor will execute and
                    deliver to the Company all of the transaction documents related to the Equity Financing; *provided,*
                    that such documents (i) are the same documents to be entered into with the purchasers of Standard
                    Preferred Stock, with appropriate variations for the Safe Preferred Stock if applicable, and (ii)
                    have customary exceptions to any drag-along applicable to the Investor, including (without
                    limitation) limited representations, warranties, liability and indemnification obligations for the
                    Investor.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">(b) <strong>Liquidity Event</strong>. If there is a
                    Liquidity Event before the termination of this Safe, the Investor will automatically be entitled
                    (subject to the liquidation priority set forth in Section 1(d) below) to receive a portion of
                    Proceeds, due and payable to the Investor immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation
                    of such Liquidity Event, equal to the greater of (i) the Purchase Amount (the "<strong>Cash-Out
                        Amount</strong>") or (ii) the amount payable on the number of shares of Common Stock equal to
                    the Purchase Amount divided by the Liquidity Price (the "<strong>Conversion Amount</strong>"). If
                    any of the Company's securityholders are given a choice as to the form and amount of Proceeds to be
                    received in a Liquidity Event, the Investor will be given the same choice, *provided* that the
                    Investor may not choose to receive a form of consideration that the Investor would be ineligible to
                    receive as a result of the Investor's failure to satisfy any requirement or limitation generally
                    applicable to the Company's securityholders, or under any applicable laws.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with a
                Change of Control intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization, the Company may reduce the cash
                portion of Proceeds payable to the Investor by the amount determined by its board of directors in good
                faith for such Change of Control to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax
                purposes, provided that such reduction (A) does not reduce the total Proceeds payable to such Investor
                and (B) is applied in the same manner and on a pro rata basis to all securityholders who have equal
                priority to the Investor under Section 1(d).</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">(c) <strong>Dissolution Event</strong>. If there is
                a Dissolution Event before the termination of this Safe, the Investor will automatically be entitled
                (subject to the liquidation priority set forth in Section 1(d) below) to receive a portion of Proceeds
                equal to the Cash-Out Amount, due and payable to the Investor immediately prior to the consummation of
                the Dissolution Event.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">(d) <strong>Liquidation Priority</strong>. In a
                    Liquidity Event or Dissolution Event, this Safe is intended to operate like standard
                    non-participating Preferred Stock. The Investor's right to receive its Cash-Out Amount is:</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-inline: 1em;">(i) Junior to payment of outstanding indebtedness and
                    creditor claims, including contractual claims for payment and convertible promissory notes (to the
                    extent such convertible promissory notes are not actually or notionally converted into Capital
                    Stock);</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-inline: 1em;">(ii) On par with payments for other Safes and/or
                    Preferred Stock, and if the applicable Proceeds are insufficient to permit full payments to the
                    Investor and such other Safes and/or Preferred Stock, the applicable Proceeds will be distributed
                    pro rata to the Investor and such other Safes and/or Preferred Stock in proportion to the full
                    payments that would otherwise be due; and </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-inline: 1em;">(iii) Senior to payments for Common Stock.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">The Investor's right to receive its Conversion Amount
                    is (A) on par with payments for Common Stock and other Safes and/or Preferred Stock who are also
                    receiving Conversion Amounts or Proceeds on a similar as-converted to Common Stock basis, and (B)
                    junior to payments described in clauses (i) and (ii) above (in the latter case, to the extent such
                    payments are Cash-Out Amounts or similar liquidation preferences). </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">(e) <strong>Termination</strong>. This Safe will
                    automatically terminate (without relieving the Company of any obligations arising from a prior
                    breach of or non-compliance with this Safe) immediately following the earliest to occur of: (i) the
                    issuance of Capital Stock to the Investor pursuant to the automatic conversion of this Safe under
                    Section 1(a); or (ii) the payment, or setting aside for payment, of amounts due the Investor
                    pursuant to Section 1(b) or Section 1(c).</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><strong>2. <em>Definitions</em></strong></p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">"<strong>Capital Stock</strong>" means the capital
                    stock of the Company, including, without limitation, the "<strong>Common Stock</strong>" and the
                    "<strong>Preferred Stock</strong>." </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">"Change of Control" means (i)&nbsp;a transaction or
                series of related transactions in which any "person" or "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d) and
                14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in
                Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), directly or indirectly, of more than
                50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company having the right to vote for the election of
                members of the Company's board of directors, (ii)&nbsp;any reorganization, merger or consolidation of
                the Company, other than a transaction or series of related transactions in which the holders of the
                voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such transaction or series of related
                transactions retain, immediately after such transaction or series of related transactions, at least a
                majority of the total voting power represented by the outstanding voting securities of the Company or
                such other surviving or resulting entity or (iii)&nbsp;a sale, lease or other disposition of all or
                substantially all of the assets of the Company.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">"Company Capitalization" is calculated as of
                    immediately prior to the Equity Financing and (without double-counting, in each case calculated on

                    knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that the Investor is capable of
                    evaluating the merits and risks of such investment, is able to incur a complete loss of such
                    investment without impairing the Investor's financial condition and is able to bear the economic

                    this Safe is for any reason held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part or in
                    any respect, or in the event that any one or more of the provisions of this Safe operate or would
                    prospectively operate to invalidate this Safe, then and in any such event, such provision(s) only
                    will be deemed null and void and will not affect any other provision of this Safe and the remaining
                    provisions of this Safe will remain operative and in full force and effect and will not be affected,
                    prejudiced, or disturbed thereby.</p>
