                Financing.</strong> If there is an Equity Financing before the termination of this Safe, on the initial
            closing of such Equity Financing, this Safe will automatically convert into the greater of: (1) the number
            of shares of Standard Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the lowest price per share
            of the Standard Preferred Stock; or (2) the number of shares of Safe Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 12pt 0;">In connection with the automatic conversion of this Safe into
            shares of Standard Preferred Stock or Safe Preferred Stock, the Investor will execute and deliver to the
            Company all of the transaction documents related to the Equity Financing; provided, that such documents (i)
            are the same documents to be entered into with the purchasers of Standard Preferred Stock, with appropriate
            variations for the Safe Preferred Stock if applicable, and (ii) have customary exceptions to any drag-along

            and indemnification obligations for the Investor.</p>

            set forth in Section 1(d) below) to receive a portion of Proceeds, due and payable to the Investor
            immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation of such Liquidity Event, equal to the greater of

            Company's securityholders are given a choice as to the form and amount of Proceeds to be received in a
            Liquidity Event, the Investor will be given the same choice, provided that the Investor may not choose to
            receive a form of consideration that the Investor would be ineligible to receive as a result of the

            set forth in Section 1(d) below) to receive a portion of Proceeds equal to the Cash-Out Amount, due and

            Stock);</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 12pt 0; margin-left: 24pt;">(ii) On par with payments for other Safes
            and/or Preferred Stock, and if the applicable Proceeds are insufficient to permit full payments to the
            Investor and such other Safes and/or Preferred Stock, the applicable Proceeds will be distributed pro rata
            to the Investor and such other Safes and/or Preferred Stock in proportion to the full payments that would
            otherwise be due; and</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 12pt 0; margin-left: 24pt;">(iii) Senior to payments for Common Stock.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 12pt 0; margin-left: 24pt;">The Investor's right to receive its
            Conversion Amount is (A) on par with payments for Common Stock and other Safes and/or Preferred Stock who
            are also receiving Conversion Amounts or Proceeds on a similar as-converted to Common Stock basis, and (B)
            junior to payments described in clauses (i) and (ii) above (in the latter case, to the extent such payments

            immediately following the earliest to occur of: (i) the issuance of Capital Stock to the Investor pursuant

            Investor has full legal capacity, power and authority to execute and deliver this Safe and to perform its

            accordance with its terms, except as limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws of general application
            relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 12pt 0;"><span style="margin-inline-start: 24pt;"></span>(b)</span> The
            Investor is an accredited investor as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities
            Act, and acknowledges and agrees that if not an accredited investor at the time of an Equity Financing, the
            Company may void this Safe and return the Purchase Amount. The Investor has been advised that this Safe and
            the underlying securities have not been registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws
            and, therefore, cannot be resold unless they are registered under the Securities Act and applicable state

            purchasing this Safe and the securities to be acquired by the Investor hereunder for its own account for
            investment, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, the
            distribution thereof, and the Investor has no present intention of selling, granting any participation in,
            or otherwise distributing the same. The Investor has such knowledge and experience in financial and business
            matters that the Investor is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such investment, is able to incur
            a complete loss of such investment without impairing the Investor's financial condition and is able to bear
            the economic risk of such investment for an indefinite period of time.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 12pt 0;"><span style="margin-inline-start: 24pt;"></span>(a)</span> Any

            the Investor or (ii) the majority-in-interest of all then-outstanding Safes with the same "Post-Money
            Valuation Cap" and "Discount Rate" as this Safe (and Safes lacking one or both of such terms will be
            considered to be the same with respect to such term(s)), provided that with respect to clause (ii): (A) the
            Purchase Amount may not be amended, waived or modified in this manner, (B) the consent of the Investor and
            each holder of such Safes must be solicited (even if not obtained), and (C) such amendment, waiver or
            modification treats all such holders in the same manner. "Majority-in-interest" refers to the holders of the
            applicable group of Safes whose Safes have a total Purchase Amount greater than 50% of the total Purchase
            Amount of all of such applicable group of Safes.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 12pt 0;"><span style="margin-inline-start: 24pt;">(b)</span> Any notice

            notice.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 12pt 0;"><span style="margin-inline-start: 24pt;">(c)</span> The Investor
            is not entitled, as a holder of this Safe, to vote or be deemed a holder of Capital Stock for any purpose
            other than tax purposes, nor will anything in this Safe be construed to confer on the Investor, as such, any
            rights of a Company stockholder or rights to vote for the election of directors or on any matter submitted
            to Company stockholders, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action or to receive notice of
            meetings, until shares have been issued on the terms described in Section 1. However, if the Company pays a
            dividend on outstanding shares of Common Stock (that is not payable in shares of Common Stock) while this
            Safe is outstanding, the Company will pay the Dividend Amount to the Investor at the same time.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 12pt 0;"><span style="margin-inline-start: 24pt;">(d)</span> Neither this
            Safe nor the rights in this Safe are transferable or assignable, by operation of law or otherwise, by either

            may be assigned without the Company's consent by the Investor (i) to the Investor's estate, heirs,
            executors, administrators, guardians and/or successors in the event of Investor's death or disability, or
            (ii) to any other entity who directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by or is under common control
            with the Investor, including, without limitation, any general partner, managing member, officer or director
            of the Investor, or any venture capital fund now or hereafter existing which is controlled by one or more
            general partners or managing members of, or shares the same management company with, the Investor.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 12pt 0;"><span style="margin-inline-start: 24pt;"></span>(e)</span> In
            the event any one or more of the provisions of this Safe is for any reason held to be invalid, illegal or
            unenforceable, in whole or in part or in any respect, or in the event that any one or more of the provisions
            of this Safe operate or would prospectively operate to invalidate this Safe, then and in any such event,
            such provision(s) only will be deemed null and void and will not affect any other provision of this Safe and
            the remaining provisions of this Safe will remain operative and in full force and effect and will not be
            affected, prejudiced, or disturbed thereby.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 12pt 0;"><span style="margin-inline-start: 24pt;">(f)</span> All rights
            and obligations hereunder will be governed by the laws of the State of [Governing Law Jurisdiction], without
            regard to the conflicts of law provisions of such jurisdiction.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 12pt 0;"><span style="margin-inline-start: 24pt;"></span>(g)</span> The
            parties acknowledge and agree that for United States federal and state income tax purposes this Safe is, and
            at all times has been, intended to be characterized as stock, and more particularly as common stock for
            purposes of Sections 304, 305, 306, 354, 368, 1036 and 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
            amended. Accordingly, the parties agree to treat this Safe consistent with the foregoing intent for all
            United States federal and state income tax purposes (including, without limitation, on their respective tax
            returns or other informational statements).</p>
